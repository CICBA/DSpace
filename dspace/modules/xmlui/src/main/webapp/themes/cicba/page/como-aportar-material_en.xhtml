<h1>HOW TO CONTRIBUTE MATERIAL?</h1> 
<p>If you are a researcher, a scholar or a member from the support staff from CIC, or if you have been so in the past, you can contribute with your work to the CIC-DIGITAL repository by following a simple procedure called self-archive. It can be done from any place with Internet access and it allows you to send digitalized material. In order to do it, these steps must be followed:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Login to the site (if you do not have a user account yet, you can create one <a href="/login">here</a>).</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="/submissions">"Upload material"</a>. Once there, the system will guide you through a number of simple steps.</li>
  <li>Complete a form with information of the work to be uploaded.</li>
  <li>Select the appropriate license of use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once CIC-DIGITAL receives the material, it will be published on the data bank after a brief verification, and you will be properly notified.</p>
<p>In case of journal articles, you can consult the editorial policies and the reproduction permissions/licenses in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php?la=en" >SHERPA/RoMEO</a>. Please, remember to upload all paper versions and any additional material you consider necessary (posters, presentations, etc.). If there is any journal's restrictions, CIC-Digital staff will manage the required embargo.</p>
